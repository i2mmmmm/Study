Therapist Training Chatbot	"The goal is to develop a chatbot using the Gemma2 model, designed specifically for training future therapists.  
One of the most challenging aspects of therapy education is mastering patient-therapist conversations, which are inherently confidential.   
This makes it difficult for trainees to gain hands-on experience without spending years in the field.  
The chatbot will provide a safe, efficient, and accessible method for therapists to practice and refine their conversation skills.
